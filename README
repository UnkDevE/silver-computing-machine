# What this project does
Given a Tensorflow network and a dataset it converts the neural network into a human readable Math function
Currently I have only tested this on MNIST, it is slow and so I'm writing a julia clone to work on the GPU
possiblity for C/C++ translation is on the cards too.


The main idea on this project is that:
A nerual network can be converted into a polynomial with weights and basies as coefficients
this polynomial is massive and can be seen as a power series, so if we inverse laplace the series
we get a readable function.

Laplace is slow *however* because there are no complex planes in the equations (we're not using i here)
so we can use an inverse fourier transform for the equation speeding it up condiserably
we then set sympy to solve this output and put it in a tex file
