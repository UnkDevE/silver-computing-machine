Conj:
Given a small enough change in a n dimensional unit,
any nonlinear function which is smooth and differentiable can be mapped
into it's linear counterparts transformed at angle theta.

**Base case:**
  1) Given a function space over closed smooth topology T
  2) And it stands that both input spaces and output spaces are linear
  3) Either the function space converges to topology T or something in T 
         For the Topology T to be smooth.

**For open Topologies:**
  1) Given a function space over smooth topology T
  2) as it stands the input and output spaces are linear
  
    Inductive steps:
    3) If the function space extends boundaries of T (B) then
    4) T is a manifold and is not the global space or topology of the function
    5) repeat until T is a global function space.
  
  6) If global space T is smooth then T is closed or clopen. 
  7) go to closed proof.

**Proof that functions over open smooth topologies are functions over space** 
  1) Given a function that takes a open smooth topology T
  2) Input and output spaces are linear i.e. the same space type
  3) For the space to be fully linear topology the transform of the function Y must within that space type
  4) Therefore within a linear space there must be a linear transform X that causes T to transform to Y.

**Idea**
  Functions are transforms over topology T, like linear transforms are over linear space.

**For non linear functions**
  Follow steps above - so long as the space is linear within the toplogy, 
  the space can be transformed in a linear manner.
  
  Why?
  
  Proof: 
    Give any injective or bijective non linear function F over a linear smooth space S,
    S^F is the function transform the space must:
      1) Shrink i.e. converge, fold within T's bounds
      2) Expand i.e. diverge, within the outers of T.
      3) Move T into a different space competley i.e. Hausdorf space
      4) Any of the above.
  
      I will now go for each proof in a smooth topology T:
        1) if the T's functions converge to toplogy X:
            X's output must be in T, therefore X is still in linear space.
            special case folding:
              if folding reduces the output space i.e. not a projection:
                then function is surjective -> go to 3).
                  # Why? 
                      example: f(x) -> |x|  
                --  an example of folded bijective projected space would be a shadow.
        2) if diverges to X:
            X's output is in extension of space S, which is linear
            # Take X as T if function is bijective to reduce compute time?
        3) if a space transform occurs:
            if both output and input are linear:
              there is a larger linear function which is the non linears counterpart:
                operations over spaces are:
                  1) rotation <-> non linear fold ex: flipping signs
                  2) transform <-> cutting out space, 
                    each point in the cut out is then moved to convergence of empty set or 
                    out of the bounds of the functions image. 
                  3) convergence <-> folding one to one 
                      if the space has an inverse space transformation, not nessearly function,
                      that doesn't exist then -> contradiction # function is not continous therefore not smooth.
                        ==> explaination: so long as both spaces exist that has a
                              function and a inverse transform (mutliple answers to one input)
                              the data can be seen as a logical OR between the mutiple answers and that input.
                              # an example would be additon 1+2 = 3, 2+1 = 3, the inverse g(3) = 2+1 OR 1+2.
        4) take as a series for each proof.

    Therfore:
      If the domain and image of function F is smooth and linear then any 
          non linear function will have a linear transform counterpart.
