Conj:
Given a small enough change in a n dimensional unit,
any nonlinear function which is smooth and differentiable can be mapped
into it's linear counterparts transformed at angle theta.

**Basically my proof is:**
1) Given a function space over closed smooth topology T
2) And it stands that both input spaces and output spaces are linear
3) Either the function space converges to topology T or something in T 
       For the Topology T to be smooth.

**For open Topologies:**
1) Given a function space over smooth topology T
2) as it stands the input and output spaces are linear

Inductive steps:
3) If the function space extends boundaries of T (B) then
4) T is a manifold and is not the global space or topology of the function
5) repeat until T is a global function space.

6) If global space T is smooth then T is closed. 
7) go to closed proof.

**Proof that functions over open smooth topologies are functions over space** 
1) Given a function that takes a open smooth topology T
2) Input and output spaces are linear i.e. the same space type
3) For the space to be fully linear topology the transform of the function Y must within that space type
4) Therefore within a linear space there must be a linear transform X that causes T to transform to Y.

phew!
